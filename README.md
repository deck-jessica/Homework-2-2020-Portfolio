# Homework-2-2020-Portfolio

## Portfolio snapshot assignment

I undertook this project to take the chance to showcase our HTML and CSS knowledge thus far and display a sample of my work in the web development field. I was also working to achieve a responsive site based on the size of the screen being viewed from, so images and content would not overflow the container, or page. I included my contact information with working links, links to projects (or placeholders in this case), and links within the header that would take you to the appropriate section within the page. Flexbox provides the stylings for the entire CSS linked page.

## Installation

This project can be viewed using any web browser from the link provided.

## Usage 

This page can be accessed and utilized to find more information about my experience in the web development field, my background, and a snapshot of my projects thus far. Only one link (the big Horiseon one) is my own work, the rest of the project images and links are placeholders for work to come!

## Credits

I used [GitHub Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) to create this ReadMe file, my Bootcamp course materials, and some minor help from my classmates and LAs.
